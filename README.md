## Purpose

This project is designed as a pre-testing assessment of a coder's efficiency in InterTecHub
. It is intended to evaluate a developer's ability to write clean, efficient, and well-structured code, as well as their understanding of React, TypeScript, and CSS.

## What to Expect

This project is not a production-ready application, but rather a starting point for a developer to demonstrate their skills. The codebase is intentionally left with some room for improvement, and it is up to the developer to identify areas for optimization and implement their own solutions.
